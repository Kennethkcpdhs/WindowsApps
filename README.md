## AutoSleep (C#, .NET CORE)

**Backgroun Story:** My laptop refused to go to sleep on timer. It had to be done manually, which caused my battery to drain quickly in the times that I forgot. So after running an energy report (using "powercfg /energy") I discovered that it was my speaker's drivers that was preventing my laptop from sleeping. Since my laptop was already past it's warranty, why not have some fun? ? :)

This app runs as a background process. It has 3 features.
1. Goes to sleep after 10 minutes withou user interaction.
2. Shows a popup and plays a tone 1 minute before the laptop is going to sleep.
3. Popup automatically closes after 1 min.

## MouseDisplayOff (Autohotkey)
